# ðŸŽ² Dicee - The Dice Game ðŸŽ²

This is a simple and fun two-player dice rolling game. When you open the page, it "rolls" two dice by randomly picking a number for each player. The player with the higher roll wins!

The page title starts as "Refresh Me", encouraging you to reload to play again.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Random Dice Roll:** Automatically generates a random dice roll (from 1 to 6) for Player 1 and Player 2 every time the page is loaded.
* **Visual Feedback:** Displays the matching dice image (from `dice1.png` to `dice6.png`) for each player's roll.
* **Winner Declaration:** The main heading ( `<h1>` ) updates to show the winner:
    * "Left Player Wins" if Player 1's roll is higher.
    * "Right Player Wins" if Player 2's roll is higher.
    * "It's draw" if both players roll the same number.
* **Stylish UI:** A clean, colorful, and centered layout styled with CSS.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the game page.
* **CSS3:** For all the styling, including fonts from Google Fonts ('Lobster' and 'Indie Flower'), colors, and layout.
* **JavaScript:** To power the game logic, generate random numbers, change the dice images, and declare the winner.
